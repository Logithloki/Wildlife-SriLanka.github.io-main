We leave early in the morning at 6 AM and return late in the evening, ending at 6 PM, for our full day game drive. You will be able to have breakfast and lunch inside the park during this all-encompassing safari adventure. We can arrange for these meals if that's what you'd like. We now offer half-day safari drives for those looking for a more condensed wildlife experience. Either the morning, from 6 AM to 10 AM, or the evening, from 3 PM to 6 PM, might be chosen for these. Axis Deer, Sambar Deer, Jackals, various Mongoose species, an abundance of birds, and other wildlife can all be seen during these enthralling wildlife tours. Some of the most elusive wildlife in the country can also be seen, such as the majestic Sri Lankan Leopard, the elusive Sloth Bear, magnificent Elephants, and graceful Barking Deer."

              "description": "Yala National Park is the most visited wildlife park in Sri Lanka because it has a large population of leopards. There are very few places in the world where people coexist with free-roaming animals, including Sri Lanka. Elephants live a distinctive and exquisite lifestyle; one can frequently observe them crossing roadways or creeping into hotel lobby areas. Yala and other parks offer a secure haven for animals, but regrettably, bad interactions do occur. All the information you require about Sri Lanka's Yala National Park is provided here."

              "description": "Yala combines a strict nature reserve with a national park. Divided into 5 blocks, the park has a protected area of nearly 130,000 hectares of land consisting of light forests, scrubs, grasslands, tanks and lagoons. Two blocks are currently opened to the public. Situated in Sri Lanka's south-east hugging the panoramic Indian Ocean, Yala was designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1900 and was designated a national park in 1938. Ironically, the park was initially used as a hunting ground for the elite under British rule. Yala is home to 44 varieties of mammal and 215 bird species. Among its more famous residents are the world's biggest concentration of leopards, majestic elephants, sloth bears, sambars, jackals, spotted dear, peacocks, and crocodiles. The best time to visit Yala is between February and July when the water levels of the park are quite low, bringing animals into the open."

These include waterfowls, cormorants, large waterbirds, and rare species like Black-necked Stork and Lesser Adjutant. Other water birds include Lesser Flamingo, pelicans, and rare species like Purple Heron and Night herons. Thousands of waterfowls migrate during the northeast monsoon, while other bird species like Rock Pigeon, Barred Buttonquail, Indian Peafowl, Black Stork, and Greater Flamingo also call Yala home. The park also features raptors like Crested Serpent-eagle and White-bellied Sea Eagle."
